## LiveChat
### Analytics
LiveChatâ€™s reporting module includes statistics like: + total number of chats + chat satisfaction + average chat duration + first/average response time + operators availability + chat to goal conversion + queue abandonment + queue conversion & average waiting time + queue conversion +chat survey stats. 
Reports are also available through API. Gathered data are exportable in CSV format.
### Data Storage
You do have access to history (for unlimited time from Team plan), data is stored in Dallas, US or in Frankfurt, EU.
### Price, Plan and Service
We charge you for the seats i.e. agents who can simultaneously sign in to either installable, web or mobile apps used for chatting.

The number of websites, agent accounts, application downloads, locations - none of these affect the price. The number of simultaneously signed in agents is key here.

Example: If you have 6 agents operating on 10 websites, you only pay $234/mo (Team Plan). Compare plans and prices: http://www.livechatinc.com/pricing/compare-live-chat-plans/

Both, Team and Business plans allow custom branding, reporting and sales funnels for multiple websites for no additional charge. You also get to hook them into your CRM/Ticketing/Other system (whether via plugin or our robust API).

There is no startup fee, cancellation fee, contract, and you can scale up and down anytime you wish.
